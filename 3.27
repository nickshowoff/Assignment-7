**3.27 (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as
shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points are
placed at (200, 0), and (0, 100). Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the triangle.
Here are the sample runs:

Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates:
The point is in the triangle
100.5 25.5
Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates:
The point is not in the triangle
100.5 50.5


import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  
  System.out.print("Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates: ");  
  double x = input.nextDouble();
  double y = input.nextDouble();

  if (x >= 0 && x <= 200 && y >= 0 && y <= 100 && y <= -x/2 + 100) {
  System.out.println("The point is in the triangle");
  }
  else
  System.out.println("The point is not in the triangle");
  

 } 
}
